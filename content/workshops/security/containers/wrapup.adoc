= Wrap Up and Q&A

That wraps up what we have planned for today.  We hope you've learned something valuable +
about Container Security that you can apply in your daily role.

What do you think? How can we help you understand Container Security better?

Before you leave, check out the *Resources* page that is part of this guide.  There you can +
find a ton of links that will further your Container education.

This *Participant Guide* will remain active for the next two weeks.  Please take advantage +
of it by creating your own Container Security environment back at your organization.

Thank you for your time and participation!
