= Exercise 1.3 - Remove setuid/setgid Binaries

There are two special permissions that can be set on executable files: Set
User ID (setuid) and Set Group ID (sgid). These permissions allow the file
being executed to be executed with the privileges of the owner or the group.
For example, if a file was owned by the root user and has the setuid bit set,
no matter who executed the file it would always run with root user privileges.

Chances are that your application doesn’t need any
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Setuid[setuid or setgid] binaries. If you can
disable or remove such binaries, you stop any chance of them being used for
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffer_overflow[buffer overruns],
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Path_Traversal[path traversal/injection] and
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privilege_escalation[privilege escalation attacks].

== SETUID/SETGID

=== Step 1:

To get a list of such binaries in an image, try running

`find / -perm +6000 -type f -exec ls -ld {} \;`

.Test the latest Debian image
[source,bash]
----
sudo docker run debian:jessie find / -perm +6000 -type f -exec ls -ld {} \; 2> /dev/null
----

You can then “defang” the binaries with `chmod a-s` to remove the suid bit.
For example, you can create a defanged Debian image with the following Dockerfile:

.Dockerfile
[source,bash]
----
FROM debian:jessie
RUN find / -perm +6000 -type f -exec chmod a-s {} \; || true
----

The `|| true` allows you to ignore any errors from find. The setuid and setgid
binaries run with the privileges of the owner rather than the user. These are
normally used to allow users to temporarily run with escalated privileges
required to execute a given task, such as setting a password.

=== Step 3:

*Build it:*

[source,bash]
----
mkdir defanged-debian

cd defanged-debian

vim Dockerfile <1>
----

[NOTE]
Copy the `Dockerfile` above. Press `i` for Insert, then cut and paste
`control + v`, then escape and write the file `esc`, `:wq`.

Build the new image.

.built the image
[source,bash]
----
sudo docker build -t defanged-debian .
----

=== Step 4:

*Now Test it to see that it has been changed.*

[source,bash]
----
sudo docker run --rm defanged-debian \
  find / -perm +6000 -type f -exec ls -ld {} \; 2> /dev/null | wc
----

It's more likely that your Dockerfile will rely on a setuid/setgid binary than
your application. Therefore, you can always perform this step near the end,
after any such calls and before changing the user (removing setuid binaries is
pointless if the application runs with root privileges).
