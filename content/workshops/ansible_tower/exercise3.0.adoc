= Exercise 3.0 - Using Ansible to Implement Security

In this exercise, we are going to use Ansible tower to run DISA STIG and NIST 800-53 evaluations of our environment.

== Adding the NIST 800-53 role to your tower node

=== Step 1:

In your wetty window (if you closed it, see the link:/workshops/ansible_tower/setup/[SETUP] step, in your workbook), type the following:

[source,bash]
----
sudo ansible-galaxy install rhtps.800-53
----

=== Step 2:

Now that you have the NIST 800-53 role installed on your Tower node, we need to create a playbook that uses it.  First, let's create a storage directory for playbooks, so that we can reference them from a Tower project, and then we'll create the playbook:

[source,bash]
----
sudo mkdir -p /var/lib/awx/projects/playbooks
sudo vim /var/lib/awx/projects/playbooks/800-53.yml
----

=== Step 3:

Let's create the needed playbook.  You should have a pretty good understanding of playbooks by now, so we won't go over this, in detail.  Please do feel free to ask questions, though, if there is something that you don't understand.

Note the use of the `register`, `with_items`, and `when` directives.  These are how Ansible implements variable creation, recursion, and conditionals, respectively.

[source,bash]
----
---
- hosts: web
  become: yes
  vars:
    scap_reports_dir: /tmp
  roles:
    - rhtps.800-53 

  tasks:
    - name: determine the most recent scap report
      command: ls -tr /tmp/scap_reports/
      register: results

    - name: create the scap directory in the web server content
      file:
        name: /var/www/html/scap
        state: directory
        mode: 0755

    - name: copy SCAP reports to the web server content directory
      copy:
        remote_src: True
        src: "/tmp/scap_reports/{{ item }}"
        dest: /var/www/html/scap
        mode: 0644
      with_items: "{{ results.stdout_lines }}"
      when: item | match("scan-xccdf-report-*")
----

=== Step 4:

Save and quit from editing, and then we will move on to the in-Tower setup.

== Configuring 800-53 in Ansible Tower

=== Step 1:

In your Tower window, click on image:at_projects_icon.png[PROJECTS]

=== Step 2:

Select ADD     image:at_add.png[Add,35,25]

=== Step 3:

Enter the following values into your new project.  Note that the `PLAYBOOK DIRECTORY` item should show `playbooks`, as an option, when you click on it.

|===
|NAME |NIST 800-53
|DESCRIPTION|NIST 800-53 Project
|ORGANIZATION|Default
|SCM TYPE|Manual
|PROJECT BASE PATH|/var/lib/awx/projects
|PLAYBOOK DIRECTORY|playbooks
|===

=== Step 4:

Select SAVE     image:at_save.png[Save,35,25]

=== Step 5:

In your Tower window, click on TEMPLATES

=== Step 6:

Click on ADD image:at_add.png[Add,35,25], and select JOB TEMPLATE

=== Step 7:

Complete the form using the following values.  Note that the PLAYBOOK field should offer `800-53.yml` as an option, when clicked.

|===
|NAME |NIST 800-53 Job Template
|DESCRIPTION|Template for NIST 800-53
|JOB TYPE|Run
|INVENTORY|Ansible Workshop Inventory
|PROJECT|NIST 800-53
|PLAYBOOK|800-53.yml
|MACHINE CREDENTIAL|Ansible Workshop Credential
|LIMIT|web
|OPTIONS
a|
- [*] Enable Privilege Escalation
|===

=== Step 8:

Click SAVE image:at_save.png[Save], to store your new template, and we are ready to run it.

Click on the rocketship icon image:at_launch_icon.png[Add,35,25] for the `NIST 800-53 Job Template`.

=== End Result

You can watch the scan run against your managed node.  Note that each compliance check is named and detailed.

Once the check is complete, you can open a new tab in your web browser, and navigate to the following URL, where `workshopname` is the workshop prefix, and `#` is the number that your instructor gave you:

[source,bash]
----
http://workshopname.node.#.redhatgov.io/scap
----

Click on the link called `scan-xccdf-report-...` to refiew the SCAP report that was generated.  Note the failures in the report; look at the machines, if you want, via your Wetty ssh session, to see what the problems might be.
