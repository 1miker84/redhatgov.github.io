.Before We Get Started

[.lead]
Overview

Today is meant for anyone who has any exposure to Ansible, whether you have used it or not. We are going to start with a short overview (yes, slideware) and then we'll get into the lab as soon as possible. That is where we will spend most of our time.

Your Responsibilities

* Have a discussion. This will be boring if it's just us up here talking for over 4 hours.
* Participate. We are going to cut you loose with Ansible here in just a little while. Have questions. Have opinions.

Hopefully you have your laptop with you. If not, please find a shoulder-surfing buddy. See? Not only can we dig into Ansible but you can make a new friend!

[IMPORTANT]
Do not cut and paste text from this document.  We really want you to learn ansible during this workshop,
and part of that experience is typing out YAML and understanding it's syntax, spacing, and alignments.
