= Exercise 1.8: OpenSCAP Security Compliance Scanning

RHEL 8 makes it easy to maintain secure and compliant systems with OpenSCAP.  +
What is SCAP? +
SCAP (Security Content Automation Protocol) is a NIST project that standardizes the language for describing assessment criteria and findings.  It also provides a vulnerability rating system.  The project's home page is `https://scap.nist.gov/` +

The essential components of SCAP are:

* XCCDF: The Extensible Configuration Checklist Description Format
* OVAL®: Open Vulnerability and Assessment Language
* CCE™: Common Configuration Enumeration
* CPE™: Common Platform Enumeration
* CVE®: Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
* CVSS: Common Vulnerability Scoring System

OpenSCAP is a project that implements tools for performing SCAP scans and remediating findings. +
You can read more about the project at `http://www.open-scap.org/` and the repository for their tools and profiles is on GitHub at `https://github.com/OpenSCAP/openscap/`.

== Exercise Description

In the following exercises we'll use the CLI to show how you can validate system compliance.  There are other tools as well, including a GUI utility and another for scanning container images.

== Section 1: Ensure the OpenSCAP scanner is installed

Ensure the OpenSCAP scanner and definitions are installed with the command below; it's safe to run even if the packages already exist:
[source, bash]
----
sudo yum install openscap-scanner scap-security-guide
----
 
The `scap-security-guide` package contains prepared system profiles for several RHEL releases and system types; they are installed under `/usr/share/xml/scap/ssg/content`.  +
You can get a summary of the profiles in a given definition file with the following command:
[source, bash]
----
oscap info --fetch-remote-resources /usr/share/xml/scap/ssg/content/ssg-rhel8-ds.xml
----
Output:
....

Looking about half-way down, you can see that this file contains two profiles:  one for PCI-DSS and another for OSPP.

== Section 2: Perform an initial compliance scan

The OSPP profile is a general-purpose profile, so it's a good place to start. +
To perform a basic compliance scan using the OSPP profile for RHEL 8, run the following command; the profile is specified by supplying the `Id` field from the output above:
[source, bash]
----
sudo oscap xccdf eval --fetch-remote-resources --profile xccdf_org.ssgproject.content_profile_ospp --results-arf /tmp/arf.xml --report /tmp/report.html /usr/share/xml/scap/ssg/content/ssg-rhel8-ds.xml
----

The resulting report file, specified as `/tmp/report.html`, can be opened in a browser.  A snippet of what this looks like:

== Section 3: Automatically remediate findings

To correct compliance issues found in the scan, we can generate a Bash shell script or an Ansible playbook automatically from the scan's findings.  To generate a Bash script, run the following:

[source, bash]
----
sudo oscap xccdf generate fix --fetch-remote-resources --fix-type bash --result-id "" /tmp/arf.xml > /tmp/ospp-bash-fix.sh
----

Double-check the HTML report to ensure you're comfortable with fixing every "failed" item.  Once you're comfortable with it, run the script with:
[source, bash]
----
sudo chmod a+x /tmp/ospp-bash-fix.sh
sudo /tmp/ospp-bash-fix.sh
----

OPTIONAL:  reboot the system to enable the changes.
[source, bash]
----
sudo init 6
