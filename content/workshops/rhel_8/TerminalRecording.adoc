== Section 1. Deploying Session Recording

To be able to deploy the Session Recording solution you need to have the following packages installed: tlog, SSSD, cockpit-session-recording.

=== Pre-Requisites
In order to work with session recording you need to have the following installed:

 - tlog
 - SSSD (System Security Services Deamon)
 - cockpit-session-recording

For this workshop/lab the environment is already configured to have tlog and SSSD installed.

=== Step 1.1: Installing tlog
This step involves installing the tlog packages.  The tlog utility is a terminal input/output (I/O)
recording and playback program. It inserts itself(specifically the tlog-rec-session tool)
between the user terminal and the user shell, and logs everything that passes through as JSON messages.

Run the following command in terminal to install tlog:

[source,bash]
----
sudo yum install tlog
----

=== Step 1.2: Installing cockpit-session-recording
The basic web console packages are a part of Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 by default.
To be able to use the Session Recording solution, you have to install the cockpit-session-recording
packages and start or enable the web console on your system:

Run the following command to install cockpit-session-recording:

[source,bash]
----
sudo yum install cockpit-session-recording
----

=== Step 1.3: Start or enable web console

Run the following command to start or enable the web console on your system:

[source,bash]
----
systemctl start cockpit.socket
----

When you have all the necessary packages installed, you can move on to configuring your recording parameters.

=== Step 1.4: Configuring the recorded users or user groups with SSSD from web UI
Specify recorded users or user groups using SSSD by listing them directly in the RHEL 8 web console.

1.4.1: Connect to the RHEL 8 web console locally by entering `localhost:9090` or by entering your IP address `<IP_ADDRESS>:9090` to your browser.

1.4.2: Log in to the RHEL 8 web console.

TIP: Your user has to have administrator privileges to be able to view the recorded sessions.

1.4.3: Go to the Session Recording page in the menu on the left of the interface.

1.4.4: Click on the gear button in the right top corner.

1.4.5: Set your parameters in the SSSD Configuration table. Names in the Users and Groups lists should be divided by commas.

= Alex:  As we spoke about, not sure what we want to have the user do.  Here are 2 screen shots that may or may not be useful.

=== Step 1.5: Exporting recorded sessions to a file
You can export your recorded sessions and their logs and copy them.

The following procedure shows how to export recorded sessions on a local system.

1.5.1: Install the `systemd-journal-remote` package.

[source,bash]
----
sudo yum install systemd-journal-remote
----

1.5.2: Run the journalctl -o export command:

[source,bash]
----
journalctl -o export | systemd-journal-remote -o
----

This creates an export file from the system journal with all its entities.

You can then copy the exported file to the `/var/log/journal/ directory` on any other host.

For your convenience, you can also create the `/var/log/journal/remote/` directory for export files from remote hosts.


== Section 2. PLAYING BACK RECORDED SESSIONS

There are two possibilities for replaying already recorded sessions.
The first one is to use the `tlog-play` tool.
The second option is to manage your recorded sessions from the RHEL 8 web console, also referred to as Cockpit.  For this lab we
will concentrate on the RHEL 8 web console.

=== Step 2.1 Playback with the web console
The RHEL 8 web console has a whole interface for managing recorded sessions.
You can choose the session you want to review directly from the Session Recording page, where the list of your recorded session is.

Example 2.1: Example list of recorded sessions

By clicking on one of the sessions you are presented with a player to view the recording in as shown:
