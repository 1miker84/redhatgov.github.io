= Exercise 1.0 - Welcome to RHEL!


== Exercise Description

To get started, we will take a tour of the web console. The web console (called `cockpit`) will be your primary interactive interface to RHEL. The console has a number of functions that allow you to manage most aspects of the installation.

=== Section 1: Overview of the web console

Here is a quick overview of all the available modules:

Next, let's proceed to a more detailed examination of each module. Please click through the web console on your host, as you read the explanations, here.

=== Section 2: System Module

image::cockpit_system.png[caption="Figure 2: ", title='Web Console System Module', 500]

The system module is the main screen that you see, when you first login to the web console. It contains an overview of the system, including the below sections:

* hardware type
** detailed system hardware data is available, from the link on the main page
* asset tag
* machine ID
* operating system
** when updates to the system are available, an "updates available" link will be present
* SSH keys
** key fingerprints for all created 'root' keys
* host name
** the system's name may be changed, and an alias may be added
* domain
** the system may be added to an LDAP/AD domain
* time and date
** time zone and automatic or manual time and date setting can be done
* performance profile
** the system's performance profile may be changed

Additionally, there are graphs that show the system's CPU, memory, disk, and network utilization.  Each graph may be enlarged, by clicking its associated link.
