= Exercise 1.0 - Welcome to RHEL!


== Exercise Description

To get started, we will take a tour of the web console. The web console (called `cockpit`) will be your primary interactive interface to RHEL. The console has a number of functions that allow you to manage most aspects of the installation.

=== Step 1: Tour of the web console

Please click through the console, as we explain the sections.

The various functional sections can be seen in `Figure 1`, and are: +
{empty} +
*System* +
Contains an overview of the system, including metadata and health graphs
{empty} +
*Logs* +
Displays current `journald` logs from all services
{empty} +
*Storage* +
Displays storage activity graphs, and logs. Allows for the management of NFS mounts, RAID devices, volume groups, VDO (deduplication) devices, and iSCSI targets
{empty} +
*Networking* +
Displays network activity, logs, and allows firewall and network maintenance
{empty} +
*Podman Containers* +
Allows for the management of container images and running containers
{empty} +
*Virtual Machines* +
Virtual machines can be created, deleted and controlled
{empty} +
*Accounts* +
Allows for the creation, deletion and configuration of user accounts and ssh keys
{empty} +
*Services* +
Displays all system targets, services, sockets, timers and paths, as managed by `systemd`, the root process
{empty} +
*Session Recording* +
Manages recorded sessions, and allows for the configuration of session recorder defaults
{empty} +
*Applications* +
Allows for the installation and removal of web console modules
{empty} +
*Diagnostic Reports* +
Creates diagnostic reports used by Red Hat support, also known as SOSreports
{empty} +
*Kernel Dump* +
Manages kernel debugging dumps, created when the system crashes
{empty} +
*SELinux* +
Allows for the setting of SELinux to permissive mode, and shows recent SELinux alerts (`AVCs`)
{empty} +
*Software Updates* +
Manages automatic package updating, and allows for the manual installation of updates
{empty} +
*Subscriptions* +
Manages subscriptions attached to the host
{empty} +
*Terminal* +
Provides an interactive shell

As you can see, many of the day-to-day management of a RHEL system can be accomplished without touching the terminal. This makes RHEL 8 the easiest-to-live-with release, yet!

=== Step 2: Run a Linux command

Now let's see how we can run a Linux command and format the output, using the `command` module.

[source,bash]
----
ansible web -m command -a "uptime" -o
----

=== Step 3: Review the setup module

Take a look at your web node's configuration.  The `setup` module displays Ansible facts (and a lot of them) about an endpoint.

[source,bash]
----
ansible web -m setup
----


====
[NOTE]
Like many Linux commands, `Ansible` allows for long-form options, as well as short-form.  For example:

----
ansible web --module-name ping
----
The command above is the same as running the command below.
----
ansible web -m ping
----

We are going to be using the short-form options throughout this workshop
====

=== Step 4: Install Maven, Git, and Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform

Now, let's install Maven & Git, using the `dnf` module.

[source,bash]
----
ansible web -m dnf -a 'name=git state=present' -b
ansible web -m dnf -a "name='@maven:3.5/common' state=present" -b
ansible web -m dnf -a "name=@jboss-eap7 state=present" -b
----

=== Step 5: Start JBoss EAP

JBoss EAP is installed now, so let's start it up using the `service` module.

[source,bash]
----
ansible web -m service -a "name=eap7-standalone state=started" -b
----

=== Step 6: Deploy an application

Next, we will deploy an application.

For simplicity sake, we will use an existing quickstart. To get started, we checkout some code ...

[source,bash]
----
ansible web -m git -a "repo=https://github.com/jboss-developer/jboss-eap-quickstarts.git dest=/tmp/checkout"
----

..and deploy the code via Maven, provided by Red Hat Application Streams.
[source,bash]
----
ansible web -m shell -a 'mvn clean install wildfly:deploy -Dmaven.test.skip=true chdir=/tmp/checkout/helloworld' -b
----

Demo site (unit test):
[source,bash]
----
ansible web -m uri -a "url=http://localhost:8080/helloworld/ return_content=yes"
----

Demo site (open this in your web browser):
[source,bash]
----
http://{{< urifqdn "" "node" "" >}}:8080/helloworld/
----

=== Step 7: Cleanup

Finally, let's clean up after ourselves.  First, stop the Red Hat JBoss EAP service, using the following command.

[source,bash]
----
ansible web -m service -a "name=eap7-standalone state=stopped" -b
----

=== Step 10: Remove packages

Next, remove some packages - as follows.

[source,bash]
----
ansible web -m dnf -a "name=@jboss-eap7 state=absent" -b
ansible web -m dnf -a "name=eap7-* state=absent" -b
ansible web -m dnf -a "name=maven state=absent" -b
ansible web -m dnf -a "name=git state=absent" -b
