= Introduction to RHEL 8


== First Login
=== Console login
The login screen has a Google-esqe simplicity to it.  Simply enter your username and password in the respective fields and press Enter (or click Login). +
''But what username do I use?'', you say?  The age-old standard Administrator account is named ''root'', but you should only use this when initially configuring the system.  For everyday use, you should use a regular user account.  For this workshop, we'll be logging in as XXXX.

=== Remote (SSH) Login
If you'd prefer just a command-line interface, Secure Shell (abbreviated SSH) is the de facto remote login service. +
From another Linux or Max computer, you can use the native SSH client (ssh); from Windows, use the open-source tool named ''Putty''' to connect to a remote computer.  For now, we won't be needing this capability, just know that it is possible.

== Finding your way around
So after logging in, you likely see something like this:
// image:images/desktop.png
This is your desktop.  It probably looks loosely familiar, but not exactly familiar.  It shares concepts and innovations with Windows and Mac OS' desktops, yet is uniquely different.  It will take some getting used to, but don't be afraid of it; most of the things you might expect to find are available, but you may initially have to look around for them. +
=== Key Desktop Elements +
For example, while the *Applications* menu has intuitively-grouped applications, but to open a file browser window, look under *Places*. +
Some applications are nearly identical across Linux, Mac OS and Windows, such as the Chrome and Firefox browsers, and the Microsoft Visual Studio Code editor, just to name a few.  There's greater variance in other areas.  For example, Microsoft Office is not (yet) available for Linux, so LibreOffice is the open-source counterpart you'll most likely encounter. +
