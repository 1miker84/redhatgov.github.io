# Future Work

One of the goals of this example workshop is to showcase all of the things that
are possible when building a workshop. Initially, some work needs to be done to
highlight what's already available. It's also expected that additional features
will be added over time.

This "lab" is a place to collect those ideas so that we don't forget to update
this workshop as we have time.
